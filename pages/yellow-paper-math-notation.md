- empty set $\empty$
- accumulation operators (if they have an index)
	- arithmetic sum: $\Sigma_{1\leq x \leq n} x^2+x$
	- arithmetic product: $\Pi_{1\leq x \leq n} x^2+x$
	- set union: $\bigcup_{1\leq x \leq n} s_x$
	- set intersection: $\bigcap_{1\leq x \leq n} s_x$
- other operators
	- set magnitude $\vert \vert s_x \vert \vert$
	- logical or $\lor$
	- logical and $\land$
	- for all $\forall$
	- there extists $\exists$
- example (equation 69)
	- $A_K^{*} \equiv \bigcup_{E \in T_A} \{ \forall i < \vert \vert E_s \vert \vert, i \in \mathbb{N}: (E_a, E_s[i]) \}$
	- English translation:
		- $A_K$ is defined to be the union, across all $E$ in $T_A$ (the transaction's list of access entries (Type 1 transactions only)) of the following expressions:
			- a set of $(E_a, E_s[i])$ for all non-negative integers $i$ strictly smaller than the size of $E_S$
			  id:: 647edd74-560f-4987-b5a9-5badeb40397a
		- Basically this just changed the data format
			- you start with $T_A$, a list of tuples such as
				- [(0xbeef, [1, 3]), (0xdeadfeef, [0, 5, 9])]
			- and you get something like
				- [(0xbeef, 1), (0xbeef, 3), (0xdeadbeef, 0), (0xdeadbeef, 5), (0xdeadbeef, 9)]
