- dvi
- output file format of TeX
- implemented by donald knuth in 1982
- typically used as input to a second program ("dvi driver"), which translates dvi files to graphical data
	- drivers also used to convert dvi to [[postscript]], pdf etc.
- unlike [[postscript]] and pdf does not support font embedding
	- the fonts it references must already be installed
