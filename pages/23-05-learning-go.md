- ch 1
	- no
		- inheritance
		- generics
		- aspect-oriented progr
		- function overloading
		- operator overloading
		- pattern matching
		- named parameters
		- exceptions
	- go workspace
		- since 2009, there have been several changes in how go projects are organized
			- => most of the advice is now obsolete
		- go expects single workspace
			- for 3rd party go tools
				- installed via `go install`
			- by default `$HOME/go`
				- can change with `$GOPATH`
	- `go env` lists all env vars recognized by go
		- some guides tell you to set `GOROOT` env var
			- this is no longer necessarry
- ch 2: primitive types and declarations
	- builtin types
	- the zero value
		- go assigns _zero value_ to any variable that is declared but not assigned a value
	- literals
		- writing out a number, character, or string_
		- integer literals
			- bases
				- default base 10
				- 0b prefix for binary
				- 0o prefix for octal
					- also: leading 0 with no letter
						- don't use, it's confusing
				- 0x prefix for hexadecimal
			- you can put underscores in the middle of your literals
				- can't be at beginning of number
				- can't have two next to each other
			- you can
				- use an integer literal in a floating-point expression
					- or
				- assign an integer literal to a floating-point number
				- => literals in Go are untyped, can interact with any variable that is compatible with the literal
					- can also use literals with user-defined types based on primitive types (see ch 7)
					- but cannot assign float literal to int (compile error)
					- also compile error to assign a value that overflows the type of the variable
						- eg assigning 1000 to `byte`
					- when type isn't declared, Go will use _default type_ for a literal
		- floating poin literals
			- decimal point
				- or
			- 6.03e23 (or negative exponent)
			- 0x; p for exponent
		- rune literals
			- characters
			- single-quotes
			- formats
				- `'a'`
				- 8-bit octal `'\141'`
				- 8-bit hexadecimal `'\x61'`
				- 16-bit hexadecimal `'\u0061'`
				- 32-bit Unicode `'\U00000061'`
				- also: `'\n'`, `'\t'`, `'\''`, `'\"'`, `'\\'`
		- string literals
			- interpreted string literal double quotes
				- eg `"Greetings and \n\"Salutations\""`
			- raw string literal backquotes
				- eg
				- ```
				  `Greetings and
				  "Salutations"`
				  ```
	- booleans
		- zero value is `false`
	- numeric types
		- int8, int16, int32, int64
		- uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64
		- zero value is 0
		- special types
			- byte
				- = uint8
			- int
				- int32 or int64
				- compile error to assign, compare or operate between `int` and `int32`
					- requires explicit type conversion
				- integer literals
					- default to `int`
				- same for `uint`
			- rune
				- alias for int32
			- uintptr
		- which one should i use
			- if your data uses a specific type, use that
			- if you're writing a library, use `int64` and `uint64`
			- otherwise, use `int`
		- integer operators
			- division on integers yields integers
				- truncation towards zero
			- division by 0 yields panic
			- `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`
			- `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`
			- `<<`, `>>`, `&`, `|`, `^`, `&^`
				- also for `=`
		- floating point types
			- float32, float64
			- zero value is 0.0
			- ieee 754
				- => large range, limited precision
					- float32 only has 6 or 7 decimal-digits precision
			- which to use?
				- unless you have to be compatible with an existing format, use float64
			- default type is float64
			- can use all arithmetic operator except `%`
			- dividing a non-zero floating point variable by 0 returns `+Inf` or `-Inf`
			- dividing 0.0 by 0 returns `NaN`
		- complex types
			- skipping
	- a taste of strings and runes
		- zero value ""
		- `==`, `!=`, `>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`
		- `+`
	- explicit type conversion vs automatic type promotion
		- also: no type can be automatically converted to `bool`
	- var versus :=
		- `var x int = 10`
			- default type of 10 is `int`
				- => `var x = 10`
			- or if you want to assign default value
				- => `var x int`
		- `var x, y int = 10, 20`
		- `var x, y int`
			- all zero values of the same type
		- `var x, y = 10, "hello"`
			- or of different types
		- ```
		  var (
		  	x int
		      y     = 20
		      z int = 30
		      d, e  = 40, "hello"
		      f, g string
		  )
		  ```
