- confidential smart contracts for ethereum
- decentralized Ethereum Layer 2 Rollup protocol
	- designed to achieve
		- data confidentiality
		- computational privacy
		- prevent MEV by leveraging [[trusted-execution-environment]]s
- design ensures that manufacturers of hardware don't have to be trusted
	- for safety of ledger
	- if
		- one manuf. is malicious
			- or
		- breach in TEE technology
			- then
		- the protocol falls back to the behavior of a public blockchain
- design focuses on
	- preserving privacy for the limited period
		- when it matters most
- tee
	- tee data cannot be read or processed outside the enclave
		- including processes running at higher privilege levels in the same host
	- sgx-capable cpu has two keys
		- Root Provisioning Key (RPK)
			- known to Intel
			- used to prove a CPU is genuine via remote attestation
		- Root Sealing Key (RSK)
			- not known to any entity outside the CPU
		- => Enclave Key (EK)
	- attestation allows user verification
		- that the enclave is running on a genuine sgx-capable cpu
		- is patched
		- program running inside matches some codebase
		- sgx application is
			- a VM compatible with EVM
			- rollup functionality necessary to interact with the L1 contract
	- Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is defined as
		- the set of computing technologies
			- that must be working correctly
				- and
			- not be malicious or compromised
		- composed of
			- hardware TCB (CPU)
			- software TCB (CPU microcode and program)
	- attestation provides to Verifier a report
		- containing the details about all components of a TCB
			- CPU type
			- sgx security version number
			- version of program
	- if vulnerability is found
		- => TCB recovery
	- cryptography
		- first enclave generates Master Seed (MS)
		- encrypts this seed with EK and sends it to MC and stores it locally on host
		- subsequent nodes receive Master Seed encrypted with their key over MC
		- L2 node invokes method on MC to submit attestation
- questions
	- can intel be trusted not to know RSK?
	- difference between Enclave Key and Attestation Key
	-
