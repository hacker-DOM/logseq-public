- `# comment`
- loop
	- each line will be
		- split with FS
		- run through entire pgm
- `condition { statements }`
	- `$0 ~ /^fo+bar$/`
- special patterns
	- BEGIN
		- true before first line
		- false afterwards
	- END
		- true after last line of last file
		- false afterwards
- lang
	- operators
		- ^ is exponentiation
	- inc and dec by 1
	- ternary op
	- while for
	- symbolic logical ops
	- regex match
		- `if ("foo" ~ "^fo+$")`
		- `if ("boo" !~ "^fo+$")`
	- multi-dimensional, associative arrays
		- `if ("foo" in assoc)` (keys)
		- to find values, either
			- loop over it
				- or
			- create a new array with values
				- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43100174/how-to-test-value-is-inside-array-with-awk/43100468#43100468
		- command line in special array `ARGV`
			- `delete ARGV[1]`
				- useful to prevent awk from assuming the arguments are files to process
			- number of args in `ARGC`
	- builtin vars
		- `$0`
			- line being executed
		- `NR`
			- number of records seen so far
		- `FILENAME`
			- name of file being processed
		- `FS`
			- field sep
		- `NF`
			- number of field on line
		- `$NF`
			- last field on line
	- builtin functions
		- sin, exp, sqrt, int...
		- srand()
		- rand()
		- sub(pattern, replacement, var)
		- gsub(pattern, replacement, var)
		- `idx = index(string, substring)`
		- `idx = match(string, pattern)`
		- `len = split(string, var, delimit)`
		- `printf(printf_pattern, vars)`
			- has default argument `$0`
		- `string = sprintf(printf_pattern, vars)`
		- `substring = substr(str, start_idx, length=inf)`
		- `len = length(string)`
		- `res = tolower(string)`
		- `res = toupper(string)`
	- files
		- doesn't have file handles
		- will automatically open a file handle when you use something that needs one
		- the string you used for this can be treated as a file handle, for purposes of IO
		- makes it feel like shell scripting
			- but to get same output, string must match exactly, so use a variable
		- `outfile = "/tmp/foobar.txt"`
		- `print "foobar" > outfile`
			- now the string `outfile` is a file handle
				- you can close it
					- `close(outfile)`
	- other
		- `system("echo foobar")`
		- `getline localvar`
			- read a line from stdin
