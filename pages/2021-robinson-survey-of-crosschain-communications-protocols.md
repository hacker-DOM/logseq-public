- top-level usage scenarios
	- value swapping
	- crosschain messaging
	- blockchain pinning
- analysis
	- how each protocol achieves crosschain consensus
	- what trust assumptions are made
	- protocol's ability to operate successfully in permissionless and permissioned contexts
	- whether have safety, liveness, and atomicity
	- whether they require changes to blockchain software to operate, or act as a blockchain application
- two requirements common in distributed systems
	- accessing data in other systems
		- SPARQL
		- REST
	- accessing functionality in other systems
		- RPC
		- COBRA
		- REST
- properties of crosschain communication protocols
	- Safety
		- bad states are not reachable
	- Atomicity
		- when the protocol finishes, state updates on all blockchains (involved in the crosschain transaction) are either committed or rolled back
	- Liveness
		- generally
			- good states are eventually reached
		- specifically
			- protocol eventually terminates
