- 2 - basic concepts
	- 2.1 values and types
		- variables don't have types, values do
		- all values are first-class
			- can be stored as variables, passed as args and returned as results
		- eight basic types
			- nil
				- one value - `nil`
			- boolean
				- `true`
				- `false`
			- number
				- integer
				- float - 64bit (double-precision) by default
					- can be compiled for 32bit
				- overflow wraps around (2-complement)
				- Lua automatically converts between floats and integers
				- coercible to strings (eg `2 .. 3`)
			- string
				- immutable sequence of bytes
				- encoding-agnostic
				- length of any string must fit in Lua integer
			- function
			- userdata
				- represents a block of raw memory
				- two kinds:
					- full userdata
					- light userdata
						- C pointer value
				- cannot be created or modified in Lua
					- only thru C Api
			- thread
				- represents independent threads of execution
				- is used to implement coroutines
			- table
				- `nil` and `NaN` can't be keys
				- value of `nil` implies key is not present
					- can be used for arrays, lists, symbol tables, sets, records...
				- `a.name` is syntactic sugar for `a["name"]`
				- table values can also be any type
					- can be functions [methods]
				- indexing follows 'raw equality'
					- equal _without_ metamethods
					- `a[2.0] == a[2]`
		- only `nil` and `false` are falsy
		- Lua can call and manipulate functions written in C
		- `type` return type of value
	- 2.2 environments and global environment
		- any reference to a free name (name not bound to any declaration)
			- is syntactically translated to `_ENV.var`
		- every chunk is compiled
			- in the scope of an external local variable `_ENV`
			- => `_ENV` is never a free name in a chunk
		- each reference to a free name uses the `_ENV` that us visible at that point in the program
		- table used as value of `_ENV` is called an environment
		- distinguished environment called _global environment_
			- in Lua `_G`
			- when Lua loads a chunk, the default value for its `_ENV` variable is `_G`
	- 2.3 error handling
		- interrupts normal flow
		- can continue by catching error
			- `pcall` or `xpcall`
		- ...
	- 2.4 metatables and metamethods
		- every value in Lua can have a metatable
		- unless otherwise stated, a metamethod can be any callable value
			- a function, or a value with `__call` metamethod
		- `getmetatable` function
		- cannot change metatable of values other than tables
			- `setmetatable`
				- multiple tables can share a metatable
	- 2.5 garbage collection
		- lua performs automatic memory management
	- 2.6 coroutines
- 3 the language
	- 3.1 lexical conventions
		- ignores spaces between tokens
		- avoid creating names that start with underscore followed by one or more uppercase letters
