- dark mode
	- 2021-22
		- i used to use `dark-mode` but it isn't that great & has bad reviews
	- 22-10-24 i tried `super-dark-mode`, but it doesn't work with `dark-pdf`
		- a workaround is to disable `super-dark-mode` on pdf sites
			- i don't think this can be configured to be done automatically since they only allow "whitelisting" of entire domains

		- so instead using `dark-reader`
		- seems to work
