- three reasons to use alt+ over hyper:
	- faster (karabiner < hammerspoon)
	- simpler ([[KISS]])
	- can be combined with other modifiers (cmd, shift, cmd+shift)
- modifier layers
	- constraints:
		- [[vivaldi]] extensions
	- modifier layer list
	- C
		- works for Vivaldi extensions
	- C S
		- works for Vivaldi extensions
		- also: [[super-dark-mode]] sets its default keyboard shortcut as `<C-S-e>` #content
			- but it looks like to change it in extension html, it redirects to `chrome://extensions/shortcuts` (where it's "Not set" by default), so that probably will be subject to these limitations
	- A
		- works for Vivaldi extensions
			- using this; #update not using
				- bound due to dvorak, qwerty and all-the-way-down
					- `j k m , u i o l d`
					- `t h m w g c r n e`
				- free:
					- `q e y`
					- `a s f`
					- `z x v b .`
				- using
					- `y` for Toucan toggle pause
					- `a` for Speechify play/pause
					- `s` for Speechify save to library
