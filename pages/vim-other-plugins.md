- [nvim-treesitter-textobjects](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter-textobjects): I still use this and it's a great plugin (especially theÂ `lookahead`Â featureÂ ðŸ˜‰). If you want to target the textobject exactly then this plugin is the way to go. However, it can quickly lead to having too many text object mappings (I had 8 before making this plugin) and it will always deal with whitespace based on the way you invoked it rather than handling this heuristically.
- [nvim-treesitter](https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter)-incremental-selection-mod: This is similar but doesn't act as a text objects. When incrementing the selection it will do so strictly by scope or by looking at the parent node which is often way too strict for practical use. For example, it will select all the arguments inÂ `(`,`)`Â then can be expanded a few times to reach the next scope insideÂ `{`,`}`, but these can both be selected more directly withÂ `ib`Â andÂ `iB`Â respectively so it would make more sense to skip them since the user probably doesn't want to select them. Incremental selection sounds nice but often isn't how people edit text (at least not me). On top of all this, it's strict with whitespace whereas this plugin will try to handle it heuristically.
