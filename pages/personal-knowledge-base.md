- Front line
	- links first go into Telegram Saved Messages
	- notes first go into [[project-notes]]
- Resources vs Permanent
	- super small things (like git submodule cheatsheet) can go into bullet points _without source_
	- medium things can go into content page, with a Resources bullet point at the top with source
		- if the info is going to be contentious, best to attach a link to that bullet also
	- large resources (academic papers) have their own page
		- resource-specific stuff can go into that page (e.g., categorization of Crosschain Communication strategies (because there are probably multiple ways to categorize it)))
		- _general_ concepts will probably go into separate page with a link to it
			- e.g. Crosschain Communication paper might explain [[hashed-timelock-contract]]
			- that will be in a separate page
			- consequently, the info from that resource will be a subset of the info in the page
			- if really diligent, can also add info _just from that resources_ in resource page
- Bullets
	- should have continuity in their thread
- Naming
	- prefer full names, as long as possible
		- e.g. `hashed-timelock-contract`
		- that way fuzzy search can find it
			- `htc`
			- `htlc`
			- `hash timelock contract`
			- etc.
- Notes
	- important, not important
		- don't necessarily write down
	- medium
		- write down
- don't repeat title in first bullet point
- use passive tense (shorter)
